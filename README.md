# Advanced Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a credit card fraud detection system using an integrated approach combining **Random Forest Classification** and **Gradient Boosting Regression**.

### 🚀 Features
- Predicts fraud likelihood using classification
- Estimates fraud risk with regression
- Uses real-world-like transaction features (amount, time, geolocation, etc.)

### 🧪 Model Overview
- **Random Forest Classifier** to detect fraud class
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** to estimate fraud severity/risk
